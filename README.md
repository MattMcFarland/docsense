### WIP

This is a work in progress

### TODO

* [ ] core-plugin/object - which will parse for
      [ObjectExpression](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#objectexpression),
      [ObjectMember](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#objectmember),
      [ObjectProperty](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#objectproperty),
      [ObjectMethod](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#objectmethod),
      and _maybe_
      [ObjectPattern](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#objectpattern)

* [ ] core-plugin/class - which will parse for
      [Classes](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#classes)
      which include
      [ClassBody](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#classbody),
      [ClassPrivateMethod](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#classprivatemethod),
      [ClassProperty](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#classproperty),
      [ClassPrivateProperty](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#classprivateproperty),
      [ClassDeclaration](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#classdeclaration),
      [MetaProperty](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#metaproperty),
      [Super](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#super),
      [ThisExpression](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babylon/ast/spec.md#thisexpression)

- [ ] Querying data, UI

- [ ] STRETCH: Support for prototype based object creation (es5), also perhaps
      usage of Object.DefineProperty(ies), Object.Create, etc.
